## Introduction
Pixel Poetry is an advanced generative AI project designed to create images from textual descriptions using deep learning techniques. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision models to convert user-provided text prompts into high-quality, unique images.

## Project Overview
This project combines NLP and computer vision to interpret text descriptions and generate corresponding images. By utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models, Pixel Poetry translates user input into visually appealing, one-of-a-kind artwork.

## Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Converts text descriptions into unique images.
- **High-Quality Output:** Produces high-resolution images.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Allows users to input a wide range of textual descriptions.
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Utilizes advanced NLP and computer vision models.

## Technical Stack
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **NLP Models:** GPT-4, BERT
- **Computer Vision Models:** GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- **Languages:** Python

## Acknowledgements
- I would like to extend my gratitude to my teammate Thakur Meghana for their invaluable contributions to the project. Special thanks to our mentors and supporters for their guidance.
